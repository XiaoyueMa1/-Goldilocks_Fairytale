# Mechanisms & Affordances  
### Sanya Reddy & Xiaoyue Ma  
### Goldilocks Fairytale Interactive Project  

Our project is about Goldilocks traveling through her journey and trying different things to find out which one is the best.  
We are showcasing these experiences through **cardboard-built interactions** combined with **Arduino-based mechanisms**.

This branch documents the **mechanisms** and **affordances** for the 9-2 lecture topic.

## 1. Overview of Our Interactive Syste

Goldilocks travels through three different cardboard “stations,” each representing a choice she must test on her journey (e.g., doors, bowls, beds, or items she compares).  
At each station, the user interacts with a **physical mechanism** (button / switch / sensor / servo movement), and receives **feedback** (LEDs, movement, sound) that communicates which option is “too much,” “too little,” or “just right.”

The system uses simple electronics (Arduino, LEDs, sensors, cardboard switches, and servos) to illustrate each part of her journey.

## 2. Mechanisms (Physical + Electronic)

### **2.1 Cardboard Interaction Mechanisms**
Each station is built from cardboard and includes:
- **Custom cardboard switches** made using foil or copper tape  
  → users activate a choice by pressing/touching the element  
- **Hinges or moving parts** that allow Goldilocks’ items to open, flip, lift, etc.

These are inspired directly by slide examples of making custom switches.

### **2.2 Buttons & Copper-Tape Switches**
- Users select an item Goldilocks tests (e.g., three options).
- Each option is connected to Arduino through:
  - foil/copper tape switch  
  - or a pushbutton  

### **2.3 LED Feedback Mechanism**
We use LEDs to visually reflect Goldilocks’ discovery:
- **Green LED:** “Just right”
- **Red LED:** “Too little / too much”
- **Yellow LED:** “Maybe / neutral / still trying”

### **2.4 Servo Motor Mechanism**
Some stations include servo-based motion:
- Doors that open when Goldilocks chooses correctly  
- A pointer/indicator that rotates to signal “best choice”  
- A cardboard element that moves to show approval/rejection  

Mechanically, the servo is mounted behind cardboard, with the horn connected to a flap or sign.

### **2.5 Audio Feedback (Optional Buzzer)**
A buzzer gives:
- Success tone (rising notes)
- Failure tone (short low beep)
- Neutral tone for exploration

## 3. Affordances (How users know what to do)

### **3.1 Perceived Affordances**
- Cardboard buttons visually look pressable.  
- Cut-out shapes “invite” touching/lifting.  
- Goldilocks icons or illustrations indicate that each station is part of her journey.

### **3.2 Signifiers (Clear Indicators)**
From the 9-2 slides:
- **Arrows** printed on cardboard show where to press.
- **Colors** (green, red, yellow) signal results.
- **Labels** such as “Try me,” “Option 1,” “Best pick,” make actions obvious.

### **3.3 Mapping**
Each user action maps to a clear output:
- **Press switch → LED lights up**  
- **Choose correct option → servo moves Goldilocks forward**  
- **Choose wrong option → failure tone + red LED**  

The mapping is intentionally simple so the user understands the cause-and-effect immediately.

### **3.4 Feedback**
The project gives immediate sensory feedback:
- **Visual:** LEDs respond instantly  
- **Movement:** servo opens/closes a cardboard door  
- **Audio:** success/failure tones  
- **Narrative feedback:** Goldilocks “advances” to next station  

### **3.5 Constraints**
- Only one option triggers the correct outcome.  
- Servo movement is limited by the cardboard linkage.  
- Switch layout prevents users from pressing multiple options at once.  

This ensures the experience is clean and prevents accidental inputs.

## 4. User Flow (Goldilocks’ Journey)

### **Step-by-Step Flow**

1. **User sees three cardboard choices** at a station.  
2. Each choice has a signifier (arrow/word/icon).  
3. User presses or touches the cardboard switch.  
4. Arduino reads the input and determines:
   - Wrong option → red LED + low tone  
   - “Just right” → green LED + success tone  
5. On success, a **servo reveals the next part** of Goldilocks' journey.  
6. User continues to the next cardboard station.
